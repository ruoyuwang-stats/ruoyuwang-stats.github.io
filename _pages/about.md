I am a postdoc at the [Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University]([https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/)) working with [Prof Xihong Lin]([https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/dempsey-walter.html] (https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/xihong-lin/)). My research focuses on methodology development for data integration problems with biased/heterogeneous data sources and causal inference with unmeasured confounders.

Currently, I'm on the job market. I am open to beginning my next adventure anywhere in the world. Please don't hesitate to contact me ([email](mailto:ruoyuwang@hsph.harvard.edu)) if you are interested in my research or want to share any comments/ideas!
