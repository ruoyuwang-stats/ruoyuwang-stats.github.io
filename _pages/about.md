I am Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/). After receiving my M.S. degree in 2017, I decided to continue my research on health-related data science field. I'm currently working with [Dr Dempsey](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/dempsey-walter.html) in social network modeling, and with [Dr ZÃ¶llner](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zollner-sebastian.html) in statistical genetics. Before, I received a B.Sc. in General Biology from [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/), where I got the chance to finish my thesis with [Dr. Zhao](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu_zhao/) as an exchange student at Yale University.

I live in Ann Arbor, and is ready for an adventure to any place in the world. I am happy to learn, talk, meet people from all sorts of field! (Perfect if over a cup of coffee :D) Please don't hesitate to contact me ([email](mailto:zyuhua@umich.edu)) anytime!
